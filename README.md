## Key Features

- **Interactive Particle System**: A custom-written physics engine where nodes connect and react to mouse input.
- **Terminal Overlay**: Authentic system boot sequence with typing effects and retro aesthetics.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass controls to adjust simulation parameters in real-time.
- **Neon Aesthetics**: A curated cyberpunk color palette designed to pop on deep dark backgrounds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas API (No heavy 3D libraries)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS + CSS Variables (No frameworks)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
